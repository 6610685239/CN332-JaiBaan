## Project Overview
The **Digital Transformation Management System** is a comprehensive solution designed to modernize the administration of residential projects (Juristic Person Management). By integrating **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** principles with cutting-edge technologies, this system aims to transform traditional manual operations into a seamless, transparent, and automated digital ecosystem.

Our goal is to bridge the gap between **Juristic Persons**, **Residents**, **Security Personnel**, and **Technicians** through a unified platform that enhances quality of life and operational efficiency.
